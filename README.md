# Project Description
This project entailed extracting, cleaning, processing, and analysing retail data for a Multinational Company selling various goods in different locations around the globe.
This project gave me a great introduction to the field of data science and data analysis, by providing me with a simulated experience of analysing data to extract insights for retail purposes.
