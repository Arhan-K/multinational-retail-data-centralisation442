Project Name: Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

Extracted sales from a database using different sources. Cleaned the data by getting rid of erroneous values, errors with formatting and NULL values, and uploaded the cleaned 
data to a central PgAdmin4 database to be accessed from one singular location.
Queried the data using PostgreSQL to obtain up to date metrics and insights.

Usage instructions:
Run data_cleaning.py to upload the cleaned data to the PgAdmin4 database sales_data. Run the queries present under each section of orders_table_alter.sql to get the required
information.
